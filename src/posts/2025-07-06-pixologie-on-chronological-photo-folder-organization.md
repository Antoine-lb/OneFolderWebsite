Pixologie Inc, run by photo-organizing pro Molly Bartelt, has spent more than a decade wrangling millions of client photos. In one blog post (June 25 2024) and two YouTube videos, she lays out a single through-line: the fastest, most future-proof way to tame a giant collection is to keep everything in dated computer folders and let tags or facial recognition handle themes later. The pieces walk through why "just search" solutions fall short and how a simple folder recipe beats slick apps for speed and clarity.

If you've got thousands of mixed print scans, phone shots and camera files—and want an iron-clad structure the whole family can understand—this method is aimed squarely at you.

## Folder-naming cheat-sheet

```
YYYY-MM-DD Description
2020 Photos
2020-03 March Photos
2020-06 Yellowstone Trip
2020-12-25 Christmas Photos
```

Use as many—or as few—date parts as you need. Year-only works for broad albums; add month or the full date when you want precision.

## Tools mentioned

- **Google Photos / Apple Photos** → great on phones, but cluttered with "junk" snaps
- **OneDrive** → keep an eye on what's stored locally vs. cloud-only
- **Mylio**, **Photoshop Elements**, **Forever Historian** → desktop managers that require steady upkeep
- **Duplicate Photos Fixer Pro** (PC) and **Photo Sweeper** (Mac) → go-to apps for duplicate hunting
- **Forever** → preferred cloud archive once local folders are clean
- **SmugMug**, **Dropbox**, **Amazon Photos** → other common sources you may need to pull from

## Organizing steps for digital photos

1. **Gather all digital photos in one place** – your **"Photos to Organize"** folder
   - Copy, move, download or export from every phone, card, drive and cloud account

2. **Work source by source to clean up folders**
   - Rename folders `YYYY-MM-DD Description` (see cheat-sheet above)
   - Move photos into properly dated folders
   - Build a nested tree: _Decades_ › _Years_ › _Months_ (or other top-level categories)

3. **Deduplicate** by comparing small batches (e.g., 2014 phone vs. 2014 camera) with Photo Sweeper or Duplicate Photos Fixer Pro
4. **When a folder is spotless, move it to the clean master** (Pixologie calls it the **Photo Estate** / **Master Family Photos** folder)

## Advice

- Always know the _full path_ of your working folders—especially when OneDrive is in the mix.
- Stick to chronological order so each event's full story stays together; use tags later for people and themes.
- Keep top-level clutter down to two working folders: _Photos to Organize_ and the clean master.
- Nest folders so you _click_, don't scroll—hundreds of items in one directory is a red flag.
- Budget plenty of time; a lifetime of photos rarely sorts itself in a single weekend.
