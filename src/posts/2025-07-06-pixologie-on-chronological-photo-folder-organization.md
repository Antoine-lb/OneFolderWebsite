Pixologie is a Wisconsin‑based photo‑estate service that has spent the last decade processing "millions of print and digital pictures" for clients. In both the blog post _Why We Organize Photos the Way We Do_ (June 25 2024) and two companion YouTube videos, founder Molly Bartelt lays out a deliberately simple, folder‑first approach: everything lives on a local drive in date‑based folders, with two top‑level buckets—one for work‑in‑progress and one for finished, de‑duplicated "estate" photos. The pitch is that folders are faster, clearer and more future‑proof than relying on search or cloud‑only solutions.

_Who is this method for?_
Pixologie targets families (rather than pro photographers) who have decades of mixed print scans and phone shots and who worry about losing the story of whole events when pics get split up by person or device.

## Tools mentioned

- **Apple Photos / iCloud** – great search and on‑device capture, but filled with "junk" screenshots and throw‑aways
- **Google Photos** – same strengths and same "junk" problem as Apple Photos
- **Mylio** – desktop photo‑manager that imports originals into its own catalogue; powerful but easy to neglect
- **Photoshop Elements** – another catalogue‑based manager with the same maintenance risk
- **Forever Historian** – catalogue software from the Forever ecosystem
- **Forever (cloud)** – long‑term storage; Pixologie uploads only after the local folders are cleaned
- **SmugMug** – cited as an alternate cloud gallery
- **OneDrive** – demoed in the second video to illustrate why you must know exactly where your folders really live on disk

## Steps to follow

1. **Gather** all digital photos into a single **"Photos to Organize"** folder (copy, move, download or export from phones and cameras).
2. **Clean each sub‑folder**:
   - Rename it using `YYYY-MM-DD Description`.
   - Move misplaced images into the correct dated folder.
   - Inside each year create a _Decade → Year → Month_ tree (or a broad topic folder such as `2020-06 Yellowstone Trip`).

3. **De‑duplicate** in small batches before you forget what you just reviewed.
4. When a folder is truly tidy, move it to the **"Master Family Photos"** (aka _Photo Estate_) folder.

## Advice

- Know the _full_ path back to the physical drive (C:\ … on Windows, Macintosh HD/Users/... on macOS) before you start dragging folders around.
- Keep at least two top‑level folders: "Photos to Organize" and "Master Family Photos".
- Separate **Scanned Photos** and temporary **Projects** folders if you need them, but don't mix those with clean masters.
- Avoid splitting events by person; use tags or facial recognition later if you really need people‑based views.
- Do the heavy work on a reasonably recent computer; it's markedly faster than a cloud interface for copy‑move‑dedupe tasks.
- **Always start the folder name with the date**, but the format is flexible:
  `2020 Photos`
  `2020-03 March Photos`
  `2020-06 Yellowstone Trip`
  `2020-12-25 Christmas Photos`
