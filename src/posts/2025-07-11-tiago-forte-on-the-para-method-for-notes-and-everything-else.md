This is my **third** set of notes from Tiago. The first two were on [photo storage](/blog/2025-07-09-forte-labs-on-organizing-digital-photos) and a [weekly digital reset](/blog/2025-07-10-tiago-forte-on-a-4-step-digital-reset). This one dives into the **PARA Method** – his four-folder framework for organising _all_ information, but the demo is squarely inside Evernote, so we're talking mostly **notes**, not raw files. Still, a little productivity-procrastination never hurts.

## Tools mentioned

- **Evernote** – Tiago's "neural hub" for ~7k notes
- **Google Drive / local disk / Dropbox** – he mirrors the same four folders in each place
- **Number prefixes** (`1_Projects`, `2_Areas`…) to keep the order consistent

## The PARA buckets (slide highlights)

- **PROJECTS**
  - Have goals
  - Have an end

- **AREAS**
  - Roles or responsibilities
  - Ongoing maintenance
  - Never completed

- **RESOURCES**
  - Any topic of ongoing interest
  - Inspiration for future projects

- **ARCHIVES**
  - Inactive items from Projects, Areas, and Resources

## Steps to follow (my shorthand)

1. **List every active project** (15–25 is normal) and give each its own sub-folder/notebook.
2. **Map your ongoing areas** (roles like _Health_, _Finances_, _Marketing_) – one folder each.
3. **Throw everything else into Resources**; it's the "someday/maybe" stash.
4. **Archive** any bucket the moment it goes cold – never delete, just move.
5. **Mirror PARA everywhere** so you never have to remember two systems.

## Advice & takeaways

- Put a digit in front of each top-level folder (`1 Projects` … `4 Archive`) so they sort from _most_ to _least_ actionable.
- When a Resource suddenly becomes active (say, "Habits & Routines"), just rename the notebook and drag it into Projects—zero re-filing.
- Most daily friction is deciding where things go; PARA reduces that to four clicks.
- Yes, we've drifted from my core "photo-folder" quest, but seeing a universal framework is useful context.

Worth the full watch if you're tempted to rebuild your note app from scratch: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6Mfl1OywM8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6Mfl1OywM8) - _Organize Your ENTIRE Digital Life in Seconds (The PARA Method)_, Tiago Forte, YouTube.
