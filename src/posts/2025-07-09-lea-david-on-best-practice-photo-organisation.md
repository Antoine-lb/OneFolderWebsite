Lea David makes "digital declutter" shorts, but this 2024 upload is a full 15-minute walkthrough aimed at anyone who's drowning in scattered camera-rolls and half-forgotten external drives. The promise: five steps, zero extra software (though she shows a couple of optional helpers). The demo is Windows-centric, yet every step maps to macOS or Linux just fine.

## Tools mentioned

- **Plain File Explorer / Finder** – primary workspace
- **Windows Pictures library** – suggested landing zone
- **CCleaner Duplicate Finder** – optional free tool to purge clones
- **External drive or cloud (any brand)** – mandatory backup target

## Steps to follow

1. **Aggregate everything** – pull photos from phones, SD cards, old laptops, cloud folders into one temporary "Photos Staging" folder on your computer.
2. **Cull obvious junk** – blurred frames, screenshots, WhatsApp forwards; do it manually or with search filters (`*WhatsApp*.jpg`).
3. **De-dupe** – either slog through manually or run a tool (she demos CCleaner → Tools → Duplicate Finder).
4. **Decide a folder hierarchy** – pick one and stick to it:
   - _Date tree_ → `2024\04_April\Trip_to_Paris`
   - _Topic tree_ → `Travel\Paris 2024`, `Hobbies\Tennis\Tournaments`
   - _Hybrid_ → `2024\Travel\Paris`, `2024\Family\Birthdays`.

5. **Rename inside each event** – bulk-rename in Explorer (`Ctrl +A` → `F2`) using `YYYY-MM-DD_EventName_##` so single-digit months get **0-padding** (`02` not `2`) and sort correctly.

## Advice

- Leading zeros matter: without `01…09`, April ("4") would sit after November ("11") in an alphabetical list.
- If you like the tree idea but dread manual moves, create the empty skeleton first, _then_ drag-drop batches—it's faster than renaming after the fact.
- Metadata tagging (people, places) can turbo-charge search, but in Windows it's clunky; treat it as a "nice-to-have", not a blocker.
- **Backup, backup, backup**: one extra copy on an external HDD _and_ one in the cloud is the minimum safety net.
