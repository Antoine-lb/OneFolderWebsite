Veteran portrait shooter **Michael Grecco** (founder of HowToArchive.com, now part of the pro-storage retailer [getprostorage.com](https://getprostorage.com/)) recorded this 2014 clip after losing billable hours hunting for an unlabelled master file. The solution he demos is a disciplined, camera-agnostic file- and drive-naming recipe—nothing fancy, just characters every OS can read. It's aimed at working creatives who need to retrieve a hero frame (or RAW sequence) years later without resorting to mystery drives and panicky spreadsheets.

## Tools mentioned

- **Plain Finder/Explorer** – all naming is done at OS level
- **Metadata (EXIF/IPTC)** – nice to have, but secondary to a clear filename
- **Adobe DNG Converter** – Grecco archives every RAW as .dng for long-term readability
- **Screenshots of drive directories** – saved in a single "Drive Shots" folder for quick visual lookup

## Steps to follow

1. **Name every file with four parts**
   1. **Date** in reverse order: `YYYYMMDD` (not the `yy` I'd been using)
   2. **Subject / Job tag**: e.g. `Martin_Steve` or `Acme_NY_Campaign`.
   3. **Creator initials**: `MGP` for Michael Grecco Photography; use team-member initials when it's not you.
   4. **Camera frame number**: keep the four-digit counter so each capture is unique.
   - _Example_: `20140504_Martin_Steve_MGP_0678.dng`

2. **Convert RAWs to DNG on ingest** – one universal format beats a decade of orphaned vendor files.
3. **Label external drives just as clearly**
   - `ARCHIVE_05A`, `ARCHIVE_05B`, etc. ("05" = chronological slot, "A/B" = mirror set).
   - Never add a single drive; always add at least two so data is duplicated.

4. **Photograph or screenshot every drive directory** and drop those images into a master "Drive Shots" folder on your workstation—cheap, visual catalogue.

## Advice

- **Underscores only** between words; no spaces, slashes, hashes. That keeps names readable on "98% of computers." A YouTube commenter (OskarBravo) echoed the same tip from a Linux tech a decade ago—funny how rarely this simple rule gets taught.
- Four-part filenames beat buried metadata; you can identify a file _before_ you open it.
- Chronological prefixes (`2014-…`, `2015-…`) auto-sort in Finder/Explorer and in backup listings.
- Drives are cheap; lost masters are expensive—buy them in pairs and label them like assets, not afterthoughts.

_Personal note_: I saw this video years ago and it shaped my own convention (`yymmdd_…`). Re-watching today I realised Grecco's full-year approach (`yyyymmdd`). But it worked for me anyways.
