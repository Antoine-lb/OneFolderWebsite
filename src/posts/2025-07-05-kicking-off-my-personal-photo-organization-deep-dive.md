For years I've been hunting for **the** way to keep my ever-expanding photo library tidy. Now I'm turning the search into a project: over the next few weeks I'll comb through every article, video, forum thread, and dusty PDF I can find about naming, tagging, and filing pictures.

Rather than hiding my notes in a private doc, I'm transforming each one into a bite-sized public blog post:

- One post per resource (article, video, podcast—whatever)
- Written exactly as if I were jotting it down for myself—no hype, no forced smiles
- Bullet lists for the juicy bits: tools mentioned, steps to follow, extra advice
- A link back to the original piece so you can check the source yourself

Why bother?

1. **Selfish efficiency** – I need a clear, opinionated method to keep my own archive sane.
2. **Open notes, open minds** – If my scribbles help you—or spark a "hey, that's wrong!" comment—great. Crowd-sourced wisdom beats lone-wolf guessing every time.

Expect short, poorly written posts focused mostly on the technical nitty-gritty . When the dust settles, I’ll roll it all into “The One Method That Works for me” and share it here.

First resource drops soon. Stay tuned, and feel free to send me your favourite link on file organization—bonus points if it predates smartphones.

_(Links to each resource will appear at the end of its mini-review, so you can follow the breadcrumb trail yourself.)_
