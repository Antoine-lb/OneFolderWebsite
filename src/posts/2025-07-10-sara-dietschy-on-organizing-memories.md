Sara Dietschy is a YouTuber and content creator who's also a new parent. In this very personal (and very long) video, she walks through how she organizes the thousands of photos she takes every year — not just to store them, but to enjoy them. Her approach blends digital curation with a strong push to bring photos into the physical world through printed 4x6 albums, photobooks, frames, and even journals. It's not a technical system, but it's a process that prioritizes sustainability and actually getting it done.

## Tools mentioned

- **Shutterfly** → good quality, low-cost prints ($0.29/print), used for 4x6 albums
- **Artifact Uprising** → more premium prints and hardcover design photobooks, good for events
- **Amazon** → basic photo albums for cheap
- **Mochi Things** → source of well-designed 4x6 photo albums
- **Etsy** → lots of nice physical photo book options and vintage photo frames
- **Label Maker** → to mark photo albums
- **NAS (she uses Synology)** → stores digital "selects" and home videos
- **Leica Q2 / Sony camera** → used for high-quality event photos

## Steps to follow

1. **Find Favorites**: As you take photos (on phone or camera), mark 1–2 favorites per moment
2. **Curate Selects**: After events, choose 10–20 favorites and store them in a dedicated "selects" folder
3. **Organize on NAS**: Keep folders for each category (`family selects`, `work selects`, etc.)
4. **Print Photos**: Narrow selects to ~100–300 per year and print them as 4x6s
5. **Make Photo Books**: Use physical albums to store and rearrange printed photos
6. **Optional**: Use design photobooks for big events (wedding, travel)
7. **Label & Frame**: Label albums clearly and frame favorite images
8. **Journaling**: Use a physical notebook to write personal memories alongside the photos
9. **Video Memories**: Edit short home videos per month and back them up to NAS

## Advice

- Focus on finding your best photos, not deleting the bad ones
- Don't aim for perfection — aim for a process you'll actually follow
- Split your system into tiers: quick-and-easy photo albums, premium event books, and framed photos
- Save editable templates for photobooks locally (don't rely on services to keep them)
- Physical photos are easier to share, revisit, and reflect on than digital folders
- Journals can hold written memories and add context beyond images
- Small memory boxes (for objects like baby keepsakes) can be part of the system too
