Based on Pixologie's June 25 2024 blog post "Why We Organize Photos the Way We Do" and its companion YouTube video "Don't Organize Photos by Person! – Organize by Date and in Computer Folders," this summary distills co-founder Molly Bartelt's case for sorting every image chronologically inside plain computer folders—and why search-only or person-based schemes eventually break down.

Primary audience: households or family historians drowning in mixed print scans and phone snaps who need a rock-solid, future-proof structure before pushing anything to the cloud.

## Tools mentioned

- **Apple Photos / iCloud Photos** → Default iPhone library; great search, but full of junk shots.
- **Google Photos** → Similar strengths/weaknesses for Android users.
- **Mylio** → Desktop photo hub that imports originals into its own catalog.
- **Photoshop Elements & Forever Historian** → Traditional "import-edit-export" managers; powerful but easy to neglect.
- **Forever & SmugMug** → Cloud galleries Pixologie likes _after_ local folders are organized.

## Things to do

- Pull every loose file/card/phone into a single **"Photos to Organize"** staging folder.
- Create a **Master Family Photos** folder tree: `Decade ➜ Year ➜ Month (➜ Event)`.
- Scan prints in decade batches, then drop scans into the same structure.
- Deduplicate _before_ adding anything to the Master folder.
- Keep "information photos" (receipts, screenshots, serial numbers) in a separate top-level folder.
- When complete, back up locally + to the cloud (Pixologie favors Forever).

## Don'ts

- Don't rely on search alone—garbage in = garbage out.
- Don't split one family event across several "by-person" folders.
- Don't let a proprietary catalog be the **only** place your edits live.
- Don't organize on an under-powered PC; it will feel painfully slow.
- Don't postpone maintenance for months—catch-up can break catalog links.
