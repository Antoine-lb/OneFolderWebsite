This is an article by the team at _Pics.io_, a company focused on digital asset management (DAM). It covers both basic and more advanced strategies for organizing photo libraries. While it ends with a pitch for their DAM software, most of the article walks through a simple folder-first approach that builds toward more scalable systems using tags and metadata.

## Tools mentioned

- **Pics.io** → Digital Asset Management tool for larger photo libraries
- _(other tools are implied, like operating system folders, but not named)_

## Steps to follow

1. Gather all your photos into a single master folder
2. Use a basic folder structure, organized by:
   - Year → Month → Event
   - Or: Family / Work / Vacation → then Year / Event

3. Name folders and files consistently:
   - Start with date (`yymmdd`)
   - Add keywords (e.g. `GrandmaBirthday`)
   - Avoid special characters like `@`, `#`, `$`

4. Back up your collection to both local and cloud storage
5. Delete blurry or unwanted photos; move less-used ones to an archive folder

## Advice

- Prioritize consistency — inconsistency across folders will make things harder to find later
- Use tags (like "sea" or "friends") if your system supports it, to avoid cross-folder confusion
- Metadata is helpful — date, time, GPS, camera settings can help you search later
- Folder-only systems have limits: they rely on memory, are vulnerable to loss, and can't easily handle duplicates
- For large libraries, tools like DAM software can help scale your system
