This video is from _How To Archive_, a series by photographer Michael Grecco where he shares tips on storing and organizing data. This one focuses on the difference between local storage (external drives) and cloud or remote storage. It's a light overview, more of an opinion piece than a guide, but it's useful to hear his take from a professional workflow perspective.

## Tools mentioned

- **Pro Storage foam containers** â†’ (self-promo) used to archive and organize up to 24 hard drives

## Steps to follow

1. Label your external hard drives clearly for future access
2. If possible, keep a second set of backups
3. Use search terms like "cloud storage" or "remote storage solutions" to compare providers

## Advice

- Cloud storage is slow for large files (photos, video, etc.), so not ideal for photographers or videographers
- Local drives are cheaper and faster, and give you more control
- If you do use cloud storage, check whether it backs up external or network drives, not just your main computer
- You can set up your own cloud-like system at home for better control, but it's more involved
