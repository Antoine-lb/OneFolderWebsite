Iris Works is a platform geared toward professional photographers and photography businesses, offering workflow solutions and gallery integrations. In their "Ultimate Guide to Organizing Your Photos," they break down the process of taming your digital (and printed) photo chaos with practical, approachable steps. The article is conversational and focused on making the task less overwhelming, with tips for both everyday users and pros managing client galleries.

This method is suitable for anyone feeling overwhelmed by a growing digital photo collection—whether you're a parent, hobbyist, or professional photographer. It's especially helpful for those using multiple devices and cloud services, and for photographers looking to streamline client delivery.

## Tools mentioned

- **Google Photos** → Great for automatic syncing and organizing across devices.
- **iCloud Photos** → Seamless for Apple users to keep everything in sync.
- **Adobe Lightroom** → Powerful for managing, editing, and tagging large libraries—ideal for pros.
- **ShootProof / Pic-Time** → For photographers delivering client galleries, with Iris Works integration.

## Things to do

- Put all your files into one place before you start organizing (gather from phones, drives, cloud).
- Create folders and subfolders by year, event, or location.
- Use consistent naming conventions, like `YYYY-MM-DD_Event`.
- Tag photos with keywords (year, place, people).
- Delete duplicates and bad photos regularly.
- Back up your collection locally (external drive) and remotely (cloud).
- Print and display your favorites, or create albums.

## Don'ts

- Avoid duplicating pictures across multiple folders.
- Don't use generic filenames like `IMG_001`.
- Don't create too many nested subfolders—it can make finding photos harder.
