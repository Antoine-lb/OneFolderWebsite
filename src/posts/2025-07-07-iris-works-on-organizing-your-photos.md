Iris Works is a studio-management platform for photographers, and its blog occasionally dives into workflow topics. In this 28 June 2023 post, author **Megan Al-Hassani** walks through a plain-language "ultimate guide" to taming both digital and printed pictures. The focus is on simple housekeeping—folders, tags, backups—rather than heavy catalog-software theory.

The piece repeatedly leans on consumer-friendly cloud apps but also name-checks pro services to keep things expandable as your needs grow.

## Tools mentioned

- **Adobe Lightroom** – example of software that can automate sorting, tagging, and duplicate removal
- **Google Photos** – suggested all-in-one cloud manager for viewing and culling large libraries
- **iCloud Photos** – listed alongside Google Photos as a mainstream option
- **ShootProof** – client-gallery service that hooks into Iris for automatic delivery
- **Pic-Time** – another gallery service supported by Iris integrations

## Steps to follow (if any)

1. **Block out regular clean-up time**, then build a folder tree by _year / event / location_ with consistent names.
2. **Import into a photo-manager** (Lightroom, Google Photos, iCloud) to auto-sort, detect duplicates, and speed up culling.
3. **Rename files for clarity**—fold in dates or places instead of leaving `IMG_001`.
4. **Tag with keywords** (year, people, subject) so searches stay fast even as the archive grows.
5. **Cull duplicates / bad shots** right away and schedule a yearly purge to keep clutter down.
6. **Back up twice**: one local copy on an external drive and one remote copy in the cloud.
7. **Print, display, or book-ify favorites** and box up physical prints by year or event for tidy analog storage.

## Advice (extras called out)

- Don't bury photos under too many sub-sub-folders; shallower structures are easier to browse.
- Skip generic filenames—searching later for "Paris 2024" beats scrolling past `IMG_2743`.
- Tag sooner rather than later; catching up on keywords for thousands of images is brutal.
- Backups aren't optional—hardware failure or accidental deletes happen.
- If you deliver client galleries, tapping **ShootProof** or **Pic-Time** via Iris can save setup time.
