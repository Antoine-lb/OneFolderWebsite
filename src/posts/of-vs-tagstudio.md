After watching this beatifully made video by CyanVoxel, we wanted to compare it to OneFolder.

If you haven't watched the video please do it, is really cool:

<br />
The app is not released, so all of this comparison will be made based on the video.

## What we agree on:

- Folders are reaching a limit
- Tags are the future of organizing files
- The software should NOT duplicate your files (like EagleCool does) because we love Obsidian
- Tag hierarchies are amazing

## Pros of OneFolder

- Open source (I don't know about TagStudio, but I can't get my hands on the code)
- You can download it now
- It does respect Exif and XMP metadata (CyanVoxel argues that is not important, but we believe it is)

## Pros of TagStudio

- The tag inheritance looks cool
- It looks like it has more features overall, I don't think is a good thing but hey, more is better

## Conclusion

I'm impatient on trying TagStudio, it looks very promesing, but OneFolder does have it's place.
