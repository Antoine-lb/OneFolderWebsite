This is another follow-up video from _How To Archive_, continuing the ideas from his earlier "World's Best File Naming System" videos. It briefly covers how he uses folders (directories) to organize shoots, and how that structure pairs with good metadata and consistent filenames. There's some repetition from earlier videos, but it does give a clearer picture of his full folder setup.

## Tools mentioned

- **NeoFinder** → used as a cataloging tool to scan drives and help locate shoots when drives are offline

## Steps to follow

1. Name your folders with the format: `yyyymmdd_lastname_firstname_MGP`
2. Inside each folder, store:
   - RAW or DNG files
   - JPEG previews for quick viewing
   - Retouched selects for client delivery

3. Use NeoFinder (or similar) to catalog your offline drives

## Advice

- File names should still be strong and consistent; don't rely only on folder names or metadata
- Fill metadata fully (keywords, copyright, contact info, etc.), but still name your files properly
- Use date-first naming to keep folders in chronological order automatically
- Avoid storing massive amounts of data on your main system—keep shoots on individual drives that are backed up

You can watch the video here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dvWvKX7KOc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dvWvKX7KOc). It adds a few useful folder-level tips but mostly reinforces earlier points from the series.
