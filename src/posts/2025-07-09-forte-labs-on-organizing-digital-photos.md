Tiago Forte (the _Building a Second Brain_ guy) published this 8-minute read on 11 Mar 2024. He walks through his current setup—Google Photos plus a few settings—and then spends most of the piece on why he prints annual 100-shot photo books. I have to admit I was hoping for a deeper dive into folder or metadata strategy; the article tilts more toward _enjoying_ pictures than _organising_ them.

If you already live inside Google's ecosystem and like the idea of turning every year into a slim coffee-table book, the approach will feel nicely lightweight. Anyone looking for a hard-drive taxonomy or Lightroom workflow will find less meat here.

## Tools mentioned

- **Google Photos** – primary home for every image, with automatic cloud backup and "Explore" AI categories
- **Google One** – paid storage tier once you outgrow the free quota

## Steps to follow

1. **Turn on Google Photos backup** (Wi-Fi only, "Storage Saver" quality, Partner Sharing if relevant).
2. Let the _timeline_ view and _Explore_ tab handle day-to-day organisation; search by keyword when needed.
3. Optionally drop big events into shared **Albums** for friends and family.
4. **Make an annual photo book**:
   - Take far fewer photos in the first place—aim for one great shot per occasion.
   - Early each January, sift the past year in timed passes until only 100 favourites remain.
   - Use Google Photos' built-in "Order → Photo book" flow; resist over-customising.

## Advice (extras called out)

- A notes app is **not** the place for large media—keep them in a service built for photos.
- Buy extra Google One space sooner than later; running out mid-trip is no fun.
- Embrace imperfection: the goal is easy access, not pixel-perfect curation.
- Distill ruthlessly—prints, slideshows, calendars all start with a tight selection, not thousands of files.
