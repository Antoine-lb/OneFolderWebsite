<ArticleImage rotation={-1} caption="Photo organization example from Forte Labs" src="https://fortelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_3687.jpg" alt="Photo organization example from Forte Labs showing their digital photo management approach" extraClasses="-rotate-1"/>

Forte Labs is a well-known productivity blog run by Tiago Forte, focusing on digital organization and creative workflows. In this article, "The Ultimate Guide to Storing, Managing, and Enjoying Your Photos" (March 2024), Tiago shares his personal journey with digital photo overload and outlines a simple, cloud-first method for keeping photos safe, organized, and meaningful. The post is aimed at everyday users looking for a hassle-free, future-proof way to manage growing photo collections.

This approach is especially suited for people who primarily take photos on their phones, want automatic backups, and value ease of access over granular control. It's less about professional or archival workflows and more about making sure family memories and everyday moments are safe, searchable, and ready to enjoy.

## Tools mentioned

- **Google Photos**: Automatic backup from your phone, cloud storage, powerful search, and simple album creation.
- **iPhoto** (Apple Photos): Mentioned as a past solution for Mac users.
- **Flickr**: Briefly referenced as an earlier cloud-based platform.
- **Facebook Albums**: Used historically to share and organize images.

## Things to do

- Store all your photos in a single, cloud-backed location (Google Photos recommended).
- Turn on automatic backup so new photos are always safe.
- Use albums to group important events or themes.
- Rely on built-in search and automatic categorization (by date, people, places, things).
- Select and distill your best photos for creative projects like photo books.

## Don'ts

- Don't store photos in generic notes apps (not built for large media).
- Avoid manual file transfers and scattered storage locations.
- Don't stress about perfect organizationâ€”focus on selection and enjoyment.
- Avoid duplicating photos unnecessarily.
