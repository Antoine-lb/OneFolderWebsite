# How To Archive on filename characters (Underscores vs. Hyphens)

<YoutubeEmbeddedVideo src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2xrGIc0zu6Y" title="How To Archive - Underscores vs. Hyphens in Filenames" />

This short video from _How To Archive_ is more of a personal convention note than a technical breakdown. Photographer Michael Grecco briefly explains when he chooses underscores or hyphens in filenames. The main focus is making files compatible and readable across systems, with a nod to SEO practices when putting images online.

## Steps to follow

1. Use **underscores** instead of spaces when naming files for internal storage
2. Use **hyphens** when naming files for web publishing or SEO

## Advice

- Avoid spaces in filenames to ensure compatibility across systems
- Use SEO-friendly naming (e.g. `actor-steve-martin-by-photographer-michael-grecco.jpg`) when putting files on the web
- For internal use, choose one convention and stick with itâ€”underscores in this case
- There's a difference between what's readable for a system and what's searchable online

You can watch the original video here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xrGIc0zu6Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xrGIc0zu6Y). It's not very in-depth, but still a helpful reminder to be intentional about naming conventions based on use case.
