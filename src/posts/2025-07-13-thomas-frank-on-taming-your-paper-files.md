Thomas Frank (yep, the same productivity guy I covered in the [computer-files post](/blog/thomas-frank-on-the-best-way-to-organize-your-computer-files)) backs up a step here and tackles _physical_ paperwork. The system itself is dead simple: three homes for every sheet of paper, plus a quick digitisation routine so most sheets never need a home at all. If your desk is a mail avalanche, this feels like low-friction triage.

## Tools mentioned

- **File box or 2-drawer cabinet** – the "main archive" with hanging folders as the top-level categories
- **Hanging folders** – become the tree's first-level branches (sub-folders or paper dividers if you need deeper levels)
- **Desk inbox tray** – catch-all for new mail; processed weekly
- **Portable folder / accordion folder** – lives in the backpack for on-the-go papers
- **Phone scanner apps (Frank uses Scanbot)** – one-tap edge detection → PDF
- **Evernote** – destination for scans; OCR makes the images searchable

## Steps to follow

1. **Set up the 3-location system**
   1. **Main file box** (hanging folders = top level).
   2. **Inbox tray** on the desk for unprocessed mail.
   3. **Portable folder** in your bag; empty it into the inbox nightly or weekly.

2. **Build a tree inside the file box**
   - Let each hanging folder be a high-level topic (e.g. _Finance_, _Health_, _Housing_).
   - If a topic needs sub-branches, drop regular manila folders inside—or cheat with paper dividers + sticky flags.

3. **Process the inbox once a week**
   - Action items (pay bill, sign form) → do them.
   - Keep-forever originals → file box.
   - Everything else → phone scan then recycle.

4. **Digitise on the fly**
   - Open Scanbot, shoot, it autosaves to Evernote's **Inbox** notebook (or a dedicated "Scans" folder in Drive).
   - Let Evernote's OCR handle future searches; no manual filenames needed.

5. **Optional extra spots**
   - _Manuals box_ – a plain cardboard bin for bulky appliance guides.
   - _Safe-deposit box_ – for birth certificates, passports, John-Wick coins, etc.

## Advice (do's & don'ts straight from the video)

- Batch filing—don't open the big box every time a bill arrives.
- Over-optimising one micro-category wastes time; sometimes a loose "manuals" bin is fine.
- If roommates leave doors unlocked, consider an off-site safe-deposit box for irreplaceables.
- Digitise almost everything: PDFs don't burn, and Evernote search beats riffling through folders.
