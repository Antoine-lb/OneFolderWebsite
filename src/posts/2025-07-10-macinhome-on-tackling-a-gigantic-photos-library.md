Lucas Roberts, Vancouver-based CEO of Macinhome, opens this clip by naming the feeling I know too well: "Mac shame" over 100K+ pictures piling up in Apple Photos. Instead of guilt-induced culling marathons, he offers a five-point mindset reset that's basically _"relax, pay for storage, keep shooting."_ I love the vibe—there are bigger things to stress over than the extra burst shots from last weekend.

If you're already deep in the Apple ecosystem, his plan turns Photos into a low-friction, all-devices vault. The flip-side (my gripe) is the lock-in: once everything lives in iCloud's proprietary library, moving away gets tricky. But inside the walled garden the experience is smooth, especially the shared-album flow.

## Tools mentioned

- **iCloud Photos** – one library across Mac, iPhone, iPad; off-site backup baked in
- **Favorites "heart"** – the only tag you need for quick triage (`.` key on Mac, tap heart on iOS)
- **Shared Albums** – drag favorites → File ▸ New Album or Share ▸ New Shared Album to invite friends
- **Keyboard shortcuts** – left/right to skim, `space` to zoom, `.` to favorite (Mac)

## Five-step system

1. **Pay for more iCloud storage**
   - Turn on two-factor auth, spring for the US$ 9.99/month 2 TB tier, and stop fighting the quota.

2. **Shoot freely** – no guilt; photos are cheap, memories priceless.
3. **Mark favorites** – heart the keepers as you scroll (Mac or iPhone).
4. **Work from Favorites** – build albums, text pics, or spin up shared albums straight from that view.
5. **Drop the deletion fantasy** – sorting tens of thousands of shots one-by-one will never happen; spend the time living instead.

## Advice & takeaways

- Use arrow keys + `space` for a fast "yes/no" pass—he shows how quickly you can heart the best frame in a burst.
- Treat Favorites as your "working set"; ignore the rest of the camera roll unless you're searching.
- Shared albums in iOS/macOS are dead-simple for group trips or family events.
- Quote that stuck with me: _"There are so many other things to worry about—why worry about photos?"_ A simple system really does go a long way.
