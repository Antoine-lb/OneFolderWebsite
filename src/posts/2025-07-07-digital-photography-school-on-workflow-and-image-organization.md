Digital Photography School is a well-known resource for photographers of all levels, offering tips, tutorials, and gear advice. In this article, a wedding, lifestyle, and travel photographer walks through their detailed process for organizing and editing images—from camera setup to final delivery. The focus is on maintaining a reliable, repeatable workflow that keeps images safe, organized, and accessible, whether at home or on the road.

This method is primarily aimed at professional and serious hobbyist photographers who handle large volumes of images, especially from events like weddings or travel sessions. It's designed for those who value rigorous backup, clear folder structures, and long-term accessibility.

## Tools mentioned

- **Canon 5D MKIII / MKII** → The main cameras used for shoots.
- **Seagate & WD My Passport Ultra** → External hard drives for storing RAW files and Lightroom catalogs.
- **Lightroom** → Main editing and cataloging tool; catalog sometimes kept on external drive for portability.
- **Photos (iPhoto)** → Used for initial sorting and selection.
- **Zenfolio** → For delivering client galleries online.
- **Adobe Creative Cloud (LR & Photoshop)** → Core editing suite; Photoshop for advanced edits.

## Things to do

- Start every session with formatted cards and charged batteries.
- Separate used and fresh memory cards during shoots.
- Download images immediately to external drives after a shoot.
- Use clear, date-based folder naming conventions (e.g., `YYYYMMDD_ClientName_TypeoftheShoot`).
- Import selects into Lightroom for editing.
- Export and deliver images with consistent naming, and provide online galleries for clients.
- Regularly delete old processed images and RAW files to manage storage (keeping RAWs for three years).

## Don'ts

- Don't overwrite or format cards before confirming successful transfer.
- Avoid mixing used and unused cards.
- Don't keep only one copy of important files—always have backups.
- Avoid letting batteries sit in gear for long periods (risk of leakage).
- Don't rely on a single storage location for critical client images.
