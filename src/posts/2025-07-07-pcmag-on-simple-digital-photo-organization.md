PCMag is a well-known technology publication that offers practical advice and reviews for everyday tech users. In their article, they break down a straightforward, low-effort approach to organizing digital photos. The focus is on reducing overwhelm and making it easy to find your memories later, even if you don't have time for perfect cataloging. This guide is aimed at anyone who wants to make sense of their growing photo collection—especially casual users who want results quickly.

This method is especially useful for regular people with years of family photos, travel pictures, or everyday snapshots. It's not tailored to professional photographers or archivists, but rather for those who want a "good enough" system that's easy to maintain.

## The Three Key Questions

- **When did you take it?**
  - Organize your photos into folders by year and month (e.g., `2025/2025 January`). This makes it easy to find pictures from a specific period, even years later.
- **Who's in it?**
  - Use facial recognition features in apps like Apple Photos, or add people's names to file or folder names. This helps you quickly locate photos of specific individuals.
- **Where did you take it?**
  - Group photos from trips or events into subfolders named after locations (e.g., `2025 Tuscany Rome Italy`). This way, you can find all photos from a particular place at a glance.

## Tools Mentioned

- **Apple Photos**: Uses built-in facial recognition to help identify people in your photos.
- **Dropbox**: Offers a bulk file renaming tool and folder structure for organizing images.
- **File Explorer (Windows)**: Used for creating folders by year and date.

## Things to Do

- Put all your files into one place before starting.
- Organize photos into folders by year (e.g., `2025`, `2024`, etc.), with subfolders for months or events (e.g., `2025 January`).
- Use facial recognition features in photo apps if available.
- Optionally, add people's names to filenames or folder names for easier searching.

## Don'ts

- Avoid duplicating pictures unnecessarily.
- Don't worry about perfection—some organization is better than none.
- Skip manual metadata editing if it feels overwhelming.
