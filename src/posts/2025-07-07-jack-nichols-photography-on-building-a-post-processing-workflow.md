Jack Nichols Photography is a personal blog focused on landscape and outdoor photography, sharing both images and in-depth workflow advice. In this article, Jack details his entire post-processing workflow—from transferring photos off the camera, through culling, editing, metadata management, exporting, and long-term archiving. The guide is aimed at helping photographers (especially those using Lightroom) stay organized, efficient, and future-proof as their photo libraries grow.

The method described is primarily aimed at serious hobbyists and professional photographers who shoot frequently and need a robust, repeatable system for managing large volumes of images. It's especially useful for those working with RAW files and interested in maintaining an organized archive for years to come.

## Tools Mentioned

- **Lightroom**: Handles transfer, import, organization (collections), editing, metadata management, and moving files between drives.
- **Adobe Bridge**: Mentioned as an alternative for raw conversion and organization, but the author prefers Lightroom for its convenience.
- **OneDrive**: Used for syncing finished/exported photos and stock images across devices.
- **External hard drives**: For archiving original RAW files and saving space on the main computer.

## Folder and Collection Structure

- All photos go into a single "Photos" folder, with each shoot in its own dated subfolder (e.g., `Photos\2019-12-10 Mt. Awesome`).
- In Lightroom, two top-level collection sets are created in every catalog: `AA To Process` and `ZZ Published`.
- New shoots are added under `AA To Process` as a collection set named after the folder, for example: `AA To Process\2019-12-10 Mt. Awesome`.
- Within each collection set, collections like `All`, `Best`, `Best 2`, etc., are created to track the editing process and culling rounds.

## Metadata Details

- **Title:** Uses the format `Major Location, Minor Location – Description of image` (e.g., `Snoqualmie Pass, Ski Area – T-rex ironing under the stars`).
- **Caption:** Currently left blank, as the author found it too time-consuming and prefers to use the title for location details.
- **Keywords:** Includes descriptive (trees, mountains, sunset, night sky), location-based, and conceptual tags, aiming for 10–20 keywords per image and using Lightroom's bulk keywording tool for efficiency.

## Things to Do

- Put all your photos into a single "Photos" folder, each shoot in a dated subfolder (e.g., `2019-12-10 Mt. Awesome`).
- Use Lightroom's collections and collection sets for organization and workflow tracking.
- Cull images in multiple passes, creating collections for each round of selection.
- Add detailed metadata: title (with location and description), keywords, and (optionally) captions.
- Export finished images in multiple formats (web, promo, high-quality JPEG, archival TIFF), each to its own folder.
- Move original RAWs to external storage after editing, and import select images into a dedicated stock catalog.

## Don'ts

- Avoid letting images scatter across random folders or drives.
- Don't overwrite original files—always keep the untouched RAWs.
- Don't skip metadata and keywording; it's essential for long-term organization.
- Avoid deleting rejected photos unless you're sure; storage is cheap, and you might want them later.
