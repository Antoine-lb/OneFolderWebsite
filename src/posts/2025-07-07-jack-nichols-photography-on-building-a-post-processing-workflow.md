Jack Nichols is a landscape and night-sky photographer who writes detailed how-tos on his personal site. In this article he breaks down the entire journey _after_ you click the shutter—moving files off the card, choosing keepers, editing, and archiving—into a repeatable "soup-to-nuts" workflow. The emphasis is on consistency and finding photos quickly years later, rather than inventing clever tricks every time you shoot.

If you shoot large batches (multi-day hikes, client jobs, astro outings) and already use Lightroom or similar DAM software, this system is squarely aimed at you. Hobbyists with only a handful of phone pics might find it overkill; working photographers will probably nod along.

## Tools mentioned

- **Lightroom** – handles transfer, folder creation, collections, and every later stage of the workflow
- **Adobe Bridge** – optional alternative for RAW conversion if you skip a full DAM
- **Card reader / USB cable** – two options for getting files off the camera; a dedicated reader is faster
- **OneDrive** – home for finished JPEG/TIFF exports and long-term storage folders
- **SmugMug** – Nichols' stock-site publisher, synced from a dedicated Lightroom catalog

## Steps to follow

1. **Capture & Transfer** – shoot as usual, then pull the card and copy to one master _Photos_ directory. Each shoot lives in a folder named `YYYY-MM-DD Title of Shoot`.
2. **Import** – bring the folder into Lightroom (or Bridge), letting Lightroom create the date folder automatically.
3. **Organise in Collections** – under two top-level sets (`AA To Process` and `ZZ Published`), make a collection set for the shoot plus an _All_ collection containing every frame.
4. **Select/Cull** – iterate through the _All_ collection:
   - First pass: flag technically acceptable shots (`P`).
   - Second, third, fourth passes: raise the bar, copying picks into _Best_, _Best 2_, etc. (or use star ratings).

5. **Develop** – edit chosen images; finished files go into a `ZZ To Pub` collection (or _To Stock_ / _To Fam_ variants).
6. **Metadata** – add a structured Title / Caption / Keywords set, aiming for 10-20 keywords; Lightroom's bulk keyword tool speeds this up.
7. **Export** – create four presets (web-watermarked, promo-JPEG, high-quality JPEG, archival TIFF) into sub-folders under `Finished Photos/YYYY-MM-DD Shoot Name`.
8. **Archive** – move RAWs to external storage via Lightroom so links stay valid, and ingest stock-worthy images into a separate "master stock" catalog that syncs to SmugMug.

## Advice (extras called out)

- Use the **`YYYY-MM-DD Title`** folder convention—never mix shoots in one folder.
- Keep everything for a shoot inside that single folder; Lightroom collections do the virtual grouping.
- Progressive culling (multiple passes) is easier than one brutal pass; disk space is cheap, so Nichols doesn't delete rejects.
- Keyword every finished batch immediately to avoid a backlog.
- Export multiple sizes once, then reuse them—saves reopening Lightroom later.
- External SSD/HDD + separate catalogs keep active work snappy and archives safe.
