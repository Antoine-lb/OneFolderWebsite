This is the **second** set of notes I've taken from Tiago Forte (first one was on [storing and enjoying photos](/blog/2025-07-09-forte-labs-on-organizing-digital-photos)); this new video widens the lens to _every_ kind of digital clutter—tasks, email, notes, files. The talk feels half productivity pep-talk, half practical sweep-up, so I'm parking it here even though it drifts a bit from pure file-organization.

## Tools mentioned

- **Cloud storage** (Dropbox / Google Drive) for the brute-force "Archive" move
- **Email** (any client) for inbox zero via wholesale archiving
- **Task manager** & **note-taking app** of your choice (he treats them as extra inboxes)
- **Slack / WhatsApp** as messaging inboxes that also need clearing
- **Notification settings** across OS + apps (the real friction point)
- Side note: he reminds us Raycast can surface files by their metadata—something I'm keen to try myself

## The 4-step reset

1. **Archive everything** – Scoop every loose file, note, and task list into a dated _Archive_ folder so you're staring at a blank slate. Nothing's deleted; it's just out of sight.
2. **Clear your inboxes** – Either archive _all_ email or pick a date cut-off (anything older jumps to the archive). Repeat for note and message inboxes.
3. **Create a project list** – Write down 10-15 current projects (anything that takes multiple sittings and has a due-ish date). Give each project its own home in your task manager, notes, and storage so related stuff lives together.
4. **Turn off notifications** – Schedule set times to check email/Slack; otherwise silence them so you train your brain _not_ to chase every ping.

## Signs you're due for a reset (his diagnostic)

- **Visual clutter** – desktops, downloads, and note apps resemble a yard sale.
- **Lack of clarity** – can't say what's important right now or what's on deck next.
- **Energy drain** – you actively avoid opening your digital workspace because it stresses you out.

## Advice, tips, and my takeaways

- **Archive first, organise later** – the one-folder dump takes minutes and buys instant breathing room.
- **Weekly review** – he folds a mini-reset into a Sunday ritual so mess never snowballs.
- **PARA fans** – projects sit at the core; if you already use PARA this reset slots neatly into the "Projects" layer.
- **File naming & folders** – barely touched here compared with his photo-book post; this video is really about _workflow hygiene_ (email, to-dos, notifications).
- Interesting sidenote: This clip also plugs Tiago's Annual Review course—worth noting because the "reset" feels like the warm-up exercise for that bigger reflection.
